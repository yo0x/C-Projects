Complexity
how good is the algorithm
Algorithms that we saw:>>>
09______________3
Bubble -Sort! >> order arrays
Max-Sort
Algorithms Complexity RULES:
Numbers of actions that he does that dont depent on the NUmber of memebers!
the most complex is the N^2
Binary Search
u look fir-stable in the middle
then if is < or > we look right or left

En el examen dan un ejercicio y hay que contar cuantos loops hay!... y
mirar la complejida!


_________________reKursia 10__________________

iteration form until now>>> for loop
recursia: sum1 = sum0+ 1
          sum2 = sum1 + 2

return = returns to the plece right after the function was called!
Rekursia resolves the problem with the problem itself
