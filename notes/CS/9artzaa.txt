d1,2 = sqrt(x1-x2)
how to write the code: -38-5
1 make design
2 check the model in_40_5
in the main i declare function that havent yet bbeen declared! its good way to  advance in the code.
then we proceede to write the functions.

CHAPTER 6


Pointers to memory

we need a fuction that changes values of another funtions.
_5_6
function can only return 1 value!
this is way we need to use the pointers in C! to return more than one value!
vars in memory _8_6
we usually specify where we want to store the value! like in scanf! by adding &D -ampercent-AND
we can declare by
int *p;
char *cp1, *cp2 = &c;
cp1 point to char memory
dp = dq = &x;
dq get x addresss and the dp gets dq
There are functions poointers aswell but wont be tought in this curse.
a   &a   gives address
b   *b   gives the value.

‫‪int‬‬ ‫‪i=3,‬‬ ‫‪j=5,‬‬ ‫‪*p‬‬ ‫=‬ ‫‪&i,‬‬ ‫‪*q‬‬ ‫=‬ ‫‪&j,‬‬ ‫;‪*r‬‬

when we refer to and adress we refer to the start of this address
_15_6 will be in the exam

in the declaration we use:
int *x,
in the call we use
&a

error in compialation are errors in definitions ! Values the compiller cant know
eror while running is when values are compiled but not valid!

*void = measn is and undefined adress! int char....
